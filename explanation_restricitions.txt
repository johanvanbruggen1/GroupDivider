Text below explains how adding additional restrictions has an effect on ideal group division
See line 188 in 'main.py' for the parameter desired_number_of_additional_constraints

###

Without any additional restriction,
so desired_number_of_additional_constraints = 0,
you get the following result:

Group 1, consists of students: 1, 2, 7,
Group 2, consists of students: 4, 8, 9,
Group 3, consists of students: 3, 5, 6,

---

If you add constraint that in every group at least one person should be having actiontype 'extravert',
while student 4, 6, 8 and 9 are extravert and the rest not, then group 1 doesn't meet this restriction.

If we add the above mentioned constraint to the program by changing
desired_number_of_additional_constraints from 0 to 1,
then you get the following result:

Group 1, consists of students: 1, 4, 8,
Group 2, consists of students: 2, 7, 9,
Group 3, consists of students: 3, 5, 6,
and now indeed, in every group is at least one student with actiontype 'extravert'; student 4, 6, 8 and 9.

---

If we now add another constraint: every group should have at least one student with programming experience level 5,
while that's only the case for student 1, 2, 7 and 9, then it is clear that group 3 doesn't meet that restriction.

If we add the above mentioned constraint to the program by changing
desired_number_of_additional_constraints from 1 to 2,
then you get the following result:

Group 1, consists of students: 3, 4, 9,
Group 2, consists of students: 1, 2, 8,
Group 3, consists of students: 5, 6, 7,
and indeed, every group at least contains student 1, 2, 7 or 9,
(while also still every group contains student 4, 6, 8 or 9, to meet the actiontype restriction)

---

This can go on by further increasing desired_number_of_additional_constraints
and by that having adding one or more of the following restrictions:
    - every group should contain no more than one student with programming experience level 3 or lower
    - student 1 and student 5 are together in one group in whatever case
    - student 1 and student 8 are *NOT* together in one group in whatever case
